The above diagram describes the network topology, displaying the relationships between the Student VNET, Router VNET, and Server VNET. These virtual networks are interconnected through VNET peering, resulting in a seamless flow of communication between them.

The Student VNET includes a single Windows Client, the Router VNET is equipped with a Linux Router, and the Server VNET encompasses both a Windows Server and a Linux Server. The diagram also presents a table that showcases the routing information, including the Route Name, Destination, Next Hop Type, and Next Hop IP.
