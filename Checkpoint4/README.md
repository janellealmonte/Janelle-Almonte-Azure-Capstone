### Part A - Creating Your Unique Network Topology

The above diagram describes the network topology, displaying the relationships between the Student VNET, Router VNET, and Server VNET. These virtual networks are interconnected through VNET peering, resulting in a seamless flow of communication between them.

The Student VNET includes a single Windows Client, the Router VNET is equipped with a Linux Router, and the Server VNET encompasses both a Windows Server and a Linux Server. The diagram also presents a table that showcases the routing information, including the Route Name, Destination, Next Hop Type, and Next Hop IP.
