## Part B - Inspecting Local Repo with git status and git log

**You can use git status command to understand the status of the files in your 
working directory, staging area and local repo. You can use git log command to get list of your commit history. How do these two commands differ?**

`git status` shows the status of the files in the working directory, the staging area, 
and the local repository. It shows which files have been modified, which files have been 
added to the staging area, and which files are in the local repository but have not been committed.

`git log` shows the commit history for a repository. It lists the commits in reverse 
chronological order, showing the commit hash, author, date, and commit message for each commit. 
The git log command is used to view the commit history for a repository, whereas git status is used
to view the current status of the files in the working directory, staging area, and local repository.

In summary, `git status` shows the current state of the repository, while `git log` shows the history of commits made to the repository.
